      "Plan: Reproduce the error locally and in staging, collect browser console/network traces and server logs, and identify whether the fault is in routing, API/controller, template rendering, static asset build, or auth/feature-flag logic; inspect the landing-page module (e.g., frontend src/pages/LandingPage or server controllers/templates and the router config), run unit/integration tests and the bundler (webpack/Vite/Next build) to catch build-time failures, add targeted unit/e2e tests to prevent regressions, fix the root cause, run lint/CI and deploy to staging for verification, then promote to production with monitoring and a rollback plan. I’ll need access to the repo, reproduction steps or an error trace (console/network logs and server logs), the deployment environment, and the framework used (React/Next/Angular/Express/Rails) to start.\n",
      "Campaign: \"First Look\" — a bold, multi-channel launch built to convert awareness into measurable revenue for your latest product. We’ll position the product around a single, emotionally charged benefit (ease/speed/status/savings) and roll out a 6–8 week funnel: a short hero film and hero image set for paid social and CTV to drive broad reach; a targeted search + programmatic buy to capture intent; a coordinated micro-influencer unboxing and UGC push to build credibility and social proof; PR outreach and an exclusive virtual launch event to create earned media; and a conversion-focused email + retargeting flow with a time-limited incentive (trial/discount/bundle) to accelerate purchase. Creative will center on a 15–30 second narrative hook + 3 UGC-friendly prompts to maximize shareability; audience segmentation will prioritize high-value cohorts (lookalike + retarget + high-intent keywords) and LTV-driven offers to improve return. KPIs: reach/impressions → CTR → trial signups/add-to-cart → conversion rate and CAC, with weekly dashboards and two optimization sprints during the campaign. Share the product specifics, primary audience, and budget and I’ll convert this into a detailed creative brief, media plan, and 8-week timeline.\n",
      "Plan: I’ll start by defining and segmenting your ideal customer profiles and prioritizing high-value warm leads in the CRM, then build tailored outreach sequences (email + LinkedIn + 2-3 targeted phone touches and one voicemailer) that highlight a crisp, personalized value proposition and relevant proof points (case studies, ROI numbers). Each sequence will run 5–7 touches over 2–3 weeks with A/B-tested subject lines and CTAs that push for a short qualifying call or demo; scripts and objection-response lines will be prepared for common barriers (budget, timing, authority). I’ll log all activity in your CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce), set alerts for follow-ups, escalate hot prospects for immediate phone outreach, and use limited-time incentives or pilot offers to create urgency when appropriate. Success will be measured by response rate, meeting rate, and closed-won conversions, and I’ll iterate messaging weekly based on performance to accelerate deal progression toward signed agreements.\n"

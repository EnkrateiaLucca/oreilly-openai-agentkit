Title: Montaigne on the Importance of Friendship

Introduction

Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592), the French Renaissance essayist and philosopher, treats friendship as one of the highest and most precious human goods. In his essay "On Friendship" (De l'amitié), Montaigne reflects on the exceptional bond he shared with his friend Étienne de La Boétie and uses that experience as the basis for broader philosophical observations. For Montaigne, true friendship is rare, inward, and transformative: it ennobles the soul, stabilizes character, and stands apart from utility, passion, and social convenience.

Friendship as Unity of Souls

Central to Montaigne’s view is the idea that perfect friendship amounts to a kind of unity of souls. He famously describes his relation to La Boétie as a fusion so complete that two persons became, in effect, one: "Because it was he, because it was I." In such a friendship, the partners share tastes, judgments, and interior dispositions to a remarkable degree. This unity is not mere resemblance or common interest; it is an intimate concordance in which each friend seems to find in the other a continuation of the self. Montaigne suggests that this closeness produces mutual recognition and mutual completion: friends understand one another without need for explanation, and each becomes a kind of trusted mirror.

Friendship as Inimitable and Rare

Montaigne insists that this highest form of friendship is rare. He cautions against expecting many such unions in life; the perfect friendship he praises is so exceptional that we should neither demand it as commonplace nor measure ordinary attachments against it. He contrasts the singular, self-sufficient friendship with more numerous, less intimate social ties and with personal relationships based on convenience, ambition, or sexual passion. Montaigne places the friendship with La Boétie on a pedestal precisely because of its uniqueness — not because friendship, in general, is unimportant, but because the exemplary form he describes nourishes and reveals something fundamental in human nature.

Friendship beyond Utility and Desire

A crucial feature of Montaigne’s account is that true friendship is not founded on utility, profit, or calculated advantage. He criticizes friendships formed for gain or social advancement; such relationships are contingent and brittle. By contrast, the highest friendship stands apart from instrumentality: it is desired for itself and not as a means to other ends. This distinguishes it from marriages (which involve duties and external responsibilities) and from convivial alliances (which may be governed by politeness or mutual benefit). Montaigne’s friend is chosen freely, loved for who they are, and loved in a way that does not aim to possess or consume.

Honesty, Freedom, and Equality

Montaigne values honesty and frankness in friendship. True friends hold one another to candid judgment; they criticize and correct because they share the same concern for moral integrity. This freedom to speak plainly comes from trust: since friends are secure in their mutual regard, they can afford to reveal faults and to accept correction without fear of abandonment. Montaigne also emphasizes equality in friendship: it is a relationship between peers with no room for domination. Each friend respects the other’s autonomy, and neither seeks to subordinate or instrumentalize the other.

Friendship and the Shaping of Character

For Montaigne, friendship plays a formative role in moral life. It steadies the individual against fickleness and helps cultivate consistency of character. In friendship, one learns fidelity, courage, and the habits of thoughtful judgment. The presence of a true friend provides consolation in suffering and counsel in doubt; it helps a person remain centered amid fortune’s changes. Montaigne’s reflections show that friendship contributes to the good life not merely as pleasure or diversion but as a moral and emotional resource.

Friendship and Solitude

Montaigne is also a careful observer of solitude. He values solitude for self-knowledge and reflection, and he treats friendship as compatible with — and sometimes complementary to — an inward life. The friend is not an interruption of solitude but a companion of thought: one with whom a person can share the inward world without losing the autonomy that introspection requires. Thus, his ideal friendship deepens one’s capacity for reflection rather than distracting from it.

The Limits and Humility of His Ideal

Though Montaigne elevates friendship, he remains modest and realistic about its attainability. He warns against expecting multiple perfect friendships and counsels prudence in the formation of bonds. He also acknowledges that human passions, jealousies, and errors can compromise friendship, so the ideal remains fragile and must be tended with care and honesty.

Contemporary Relevance

Montaigne’s insights remain strikingly relevant today. In an era of transactional relationships and social networking, his insistence that the truest friendships are non-instrumental, candid, and rare invites reflection on how we form and value social bonds. His emphasis on mutual understanding and moral candor suggests that deep friendships can counter fragmentation and superficiality by fostering integrity, empathy, and steadiness of character.

Conclusion

Montaigne regards friendship as a profound human good: a rare, self-sustaining unity that elevates character, provides consolation, and enables honest self-knowledge. While acknowledging its fragility and scarcity, he treats the perfect friendship as a model of how human beings can relate without calculation, domination, or dependency. For Montaigne, to have one true friend is to possess something akin to having a second self — and that, he implies, is among life’s greatest blessings.
